BottomSheet is an Android component which presents a dismissible view from the bottom of the screen. BottomSheet can be a useful replacement for dialogs and menus but can hold any view so the use cases are endless. This repository includes the BottomSheet component itself but also includes a set of common view components presented in a bottom sheet. These are located in the commons module.
